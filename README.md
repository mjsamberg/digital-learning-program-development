# Digital Learning Program Development

This website contains the course readings for ECI518: Digital Learning Program and Staff Development. The text on this site was written by [Mark Samberg](http://go.ncsu.edu/mark) and is made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA license). All content is housed in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mjsamberg/digital-learning-program-development) and the markdown content is located in the "content" folder. You're free to use any content you would like, but I ask that you rebrand it for your institution (or use the Markdown files exclusively) if you choose to use the site wholesale. While much of the content is generally applicable, some of the content is specific to North Carolina and is labeled appropriately.

"Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) programs are extremely popular and extremely misunderstood in the ed-tech world. At the most basic level, BYOD defines the role of personally owned devices in the school environment. However, there is a misconception that BYOD is done as a cost-savings or in place of a school-owned device. In many successful implementations, BYOD is used as a supplement to a 1:1 program, or creates a situation where students can use the devices they're most comfortable with (use my personal MacBook instead of my school Windows device) or already own (use my personal iPad instead of a school iPad). 

It's important to differentiate between BYOD and guest access. A BYOD program is well-defined: students are told the types of devices they can bring, the software that must be loaded on it, and any accessories they may need to have. There are several BYOD schools that allow students to bring any device to school they want, so long as that device is a late-model iPad with an external keyboard. A well defined BYOD program mitigates some of the equity issues that may occur with one student bringing a more powerful laptop than the school requires - since the students are all using similar tools, the "cooler" device provides no functional benefit over the school issued device (this takes work). By contrast, guest access refers simply to allowing personally owned devices to connect to the school network.

BYOD, guest access, and 1:1 programs can all be combined to create your school's device strategy.

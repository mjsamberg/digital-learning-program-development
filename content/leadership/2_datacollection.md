The [Deming Cycle][1] is a standard and common cycle for change management, consisting of four components: Plan, Do, Study, Act. 
## Data Collection
Collecting good data is essential to developing a vision for digital-age learning. In traditional research, we start with your question(s) in mind, and attempt to find or collect data that answers our question(s). In a this context, however, you collect data we the purpose of developing our questions. Additionally, a good data collection process will include both qualitative and quantitative data, and use a variety of datasets to ensure that they can find multiple data points to validate a conclusion or indicate a need. 
* **Quantitative data** are data in the forms of numbers and statistics. Quantitative data may come in the form of data collected from surveys, research, frequency counts, expenses, locations, etc.
* **Qualitative data** are data that are not typically analyzed numerically, but rather through trends and patterns that emerge in their collection. Qualitative data may come in the form of interviews, observations, written documents, etc.

Imagine that you are asked to build a garden for your school. The garden will grow fruits and vegetables that can be sold at cost to community citizens who need access to inexpensive fresh food. In this example, you might want to collect data about soil and sunlight conditions around the school. You might also seek out public data sources about the average temperature and rainfall at different times during the school year, what crops could be grown given the conditions, characteristics of an ideal garden, and what supplies you might need. However, because designers are also focusing on designing for real people, a designer would want to go out into the community and talk to the people who will actually purchase the fruits and vegetables to find out what they need. This may include asking about their current diet and finding out what fruits and vegetables they know how to cook with. It will also likely involve finding out if this is a service that they would actually need and if there are any potential obstacles to them using it. There are no "wrong questions", and it is always possible to collect more data as new questions arise.

### Focus Groups
One technique that is often used to collect data is a **focus group**. A focus group is a small group of stakeholders that are pulled together for the purpose of researching the needs of that stakeholder group. Groups may be _homogeneous_ (all the same type of stakeholder, i.e. all students) or _heterogeneous_ (different groups of stakeholders together). Focus group participants should be diverse and a focus group should represent the larger population across multiple dimensions. The goal of a moderator in a focus group is to ask a starter question and then probe for follow-up as needed. It's a best practice to record and transcribe a focus group so that themes can be more easily identified. In a digital-age learning focus group, I usually only have two questions:
* What should school look like in the digital-age in XYZ school/district?
* How does technology support this goal?
From there, I typically will see where the conversation goes, and ask probing questions as needed. For a moderator, it's critical not to bias the focus group or to ask leading questions while probing for deeper responses. After the first focus group, it's typically okay to follow-up with major points from previous focus groups to look for points of convergence and divergence. 

### Surveys
Surveys also provide valuable data for developing a vision. The [School Technology Needs Assessment (STNA) for Teachers][2] and [for students][3] are older surveys currently being revised that provide insight into student needs, comfort, and use of technology and digital tools. The [Texas Teacher School Technology and Readiness (STaR)][4] chart is a rubric that teachers can use to self-assess their readiness and status in digital learning.

### Rubrics
The [North Carolina Digital Learning Progress Rubric][5] and the assessments linked in the [Future Ready Framework][6] can be used to assess school and district-level readiness for digital-age learning. 

## Data Analysis
Once data has been collected, the **analysis** phase begins. Note that during this phase, you may determine you need more data - it's perfectly okay to go and collect more. 

In the analysis phase, we begin to process all of the data that you collected. Begin by reviewing all of the qualitative data collected and look for themes in the data. In the process, use a variety of statistical techniques to organize and review your quantitative data. While this can involve more advanced statistics, you can often get what you need from looking at a simple correlation between two datasets. 

The most challenging part of this process is often in identifying how to link two unrelated data sets (e.g., average temperature and average rainfall) to a third dataset (e.g., ideal crops for a specific location). This will be done differently depending on the data collected, but the simplest process is typically the most ideal. The result will likely be a data set that is incomplete, and you'll find yourself needing to collect more data to incorporate into your analysis before you proceed further.

## Interpretation 
After your data have been analyzed, you will turn to the interpretation phase of the data collection process. In this phase, you are looking at your dataset in order to try to figure out what the data are telling you.

In the interpretation phase, it is important to be aware of biases. In traditional statistics, bias is something that we try very hard to avoid. While it's important to not let our own biases influence our interpretation of the data, _the opinions, biases and perceptions of our stakeholders are an important and vital source of data_ that should be included and analyzed as a part of our data collection and should influence our interpretation of it. When infrastructure projects are built, for example, many people who are in favor of a project don't want the project to disrupt their commute or create too much noise at their house. It's important to hear and consider these concerns in the final design.

In order to generate buy-in from stakeholders in the process, it's important to share interpretations of the data once they have been collected. These representations may take the form of summary reports, infographics, narrative stories, or through making data available in databases or electronic data structures. And while you may share raw data with your stakeholders, it's more likely that they will be focused on what you've learned from the data and what you've identified as a resulting need. In design, these summaries would be tailored to the specific stakeholder group, and used to both validate your interpretation and to collect additional data. 

Once themes have been identified, conduct a root cause analysis to ensure that you have fully identified "why" a problem or barrier may exist.

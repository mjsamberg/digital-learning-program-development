Semantic styling is an accessibility requirement. But it also brings us things like reader mode which makes reading easier. Captions and transcripts are useful for people with hearing difficulties, but also with attention difficulties or ESL students or for people who just prefer to read. Access is a "minimum threshold" - while we make sure all children have access to all materials. But we don't tend to tailor materials to the needs of each student, which is something that technology, combined with our wealth of digital resources enables us to do. When we make adjustments for students with disabilities, we tend to do it to provide students with disabilities with an "average" classroom experience. As Harvard researcher Todd Rose points out, there is really no such thing as the "average student":

We know that all students learn differently. The Universal Design for Learning framework supports teachers in designing high-quality learning experiences for all learners. While this includes accessible content, it is much more. UDL is designed to support all students, presenting materials in multiple ways, giving students flexibility to interact with the material in the way that works best for them, and provides for different ways for students to express their knowledge. The intent of a UDL classroom is inaccurately summarized as an "IEP for all students", providing each with the supports and accommodations they need, which can reduce stigma for all students and provide them the tools they need.

For CTOs and ITFs, UDL is a great framework to use to approach digital tools in the classroom. Individual tools or collections of tools can be used in service of the UDL principles.

UDL is designed across three guiding principles: 
* Providing content in multiple formats
* Providing multiple means for students to express what they know
* Provide students with multiple means of engagement

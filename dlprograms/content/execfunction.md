Because of the dynamic nature of educational technology tools, and the cognitive load of needing to switch between tasks on a computer (or offline and online tasks), students (including, but definitely not limited to students with disabilities) often need support in two specific areas: executive functioning and self-regulation. 

The switch to remote learning has exacerbated challenges for students who struggle with either executive functioning and/or self-regulation. However, supporting executive functioning and self-regulation is a critical component of accessibility that is only partially solved by the software. ITFs and teachers have the responsibility to blend accessible tools with accessible learning environments.

## Executive Functioning
Executive functioning is described as the "secretary system of the brain". Executive function is the set skills involved to let us set goals, plan, and execute. Executive function is responsible for many skills including attention, organization, planning and prioritizing, starting tasks and remaining on task, understanding points of view, regulating emotion, and keeping track of what you are doing. There are [three major areas of executive functioning][1]:
* **Working Memory** - The ability to hold information in your head as you shift between tasks and engage in tasks.
* **Cognitive Flexibility** - The ability to switch between tasks and to examine a task from multiple perspectives.
* **Inhibitory Control ** - The ability to control behavior and self-monitor.

Students who struggle with executive functioning issues may sometimes be labeled as having ADHD, as ADHD is a problem with executive functioning. Students who struggle with executive function can sometimes be incorrectly labeled as having a disability. However, executive functioning skills are not innate, and can be taught or supported.

People struggling with executive functioning skills may have trouble starting or working through tasks, have trouble with changing routines or setting goals, have trouble organizing their thoughts, or have difficulty following directions and managing their time. 

## Self-Regulation
Self-regulation is not the same thing as self-control. Self-regulation allows people to manage their emotions, behavior, and body movement when they're uncomfortable or stressed. Students who struggle with self-regulation may act impulsively in emotional situations, have a hard time winding down, or experience a "meltdown" when stressed. Kids with sensory processing or executive functioning issues may struggle with self-regulation. Three body-senses contribute to self-regulation, and students who struggle with one or more of these senses may struggle with self-regulation:

* **Interoception**: The interoceptive sense helps you understand what is happening inside your body. This is the sense that tells you when you're hungry or cold. A child who struggles with interoception issues may feel an itch as intense pain, may not know when they are too hot or too cold. These students may also have trouble understanding their emotions, as they cannot understand their body's physical reactions to emotion.
* **Proprioception**: The proprioceptive sense helps you understand how your body moves and the position of your body. A child who struggles with proprioception issues may struggle with coordinating motor movements or crave sensory input, and may struggle with activities that require significant amounts of motor planning such as handwriting or typing. Other students may not register as much proprioceptive input, so they may struggle to sit through a synchronous learning session without sensory input.
* **Vestibular Sense**: The vestibular sense is your body's sense of balance and where your body is in space (spatial orientation). A child who struggles with vestibular sensory issues may want to wobble or appear "clumsy", and may have difficulty looking up at a computer monitor and then down at their paper, or may under-register sensory input and may appear on a synchronous session to be attentive but may be struggling to pay attention.

These three systems work in concert to help self-regulate. While these systems control physical movement in the body, students who are frustrated, tired, or overwhelmed may act-out before they realize their body is out of sorts. Students may lash-out emotionally or physically or can begin to cry or move in a way that's inappropriate.

Students who struggle with executive function or self-regulation may have an IEP which includes occupational therapy provided by the school district or the student may see an occupational therapist privately outside of the school setting. 

## Supporting Executive Functioning and Self-Regulation in Remote Learning
The content below is taken from a professional learning course I recently worked on, called [Teaching Remotely: A Practical Guide][2]. These are provided as direct strategies for teachers in a remote learning environment, but should also be considered when designing other types of learning experiences.

### Executive Functioning
In online learning environments, students may struggle especially during asynchronous times where students are required to plan their day and complete their assignments independently. To support students with executive functioning in remote learning, consider the following strategies:
* **Model and reinforce expectations frequently**. Be explicit about what you expect from your students and be consistent. Over-communicate these expectations and ensure that they are documented for a student to refer back to them.
* **Establish a consistent structure within your learning management system**. Use the same general format for your LMS week-by-week. To the extent possible, encourage other teachers to use a similar structure to reduce the variability between classes. Use consistent graphics, symbols, fonts and colors, along with consistent labeling to identify the different readings, assignments, and information in the course.
* **Group content into small, manageable chunks.**
* **Create lists that identify the tasks a student should be working on day-by-day**. A detailed list of the tasks a student should be working on in a week (with approximate times) along with the order that they should be approaching the tasks will help students make a plan and monitor their progress. If students have choices, those choices should be clearly delineated. Make this available for the student to refer to as needed. Consider making it available for students to make their own printed or virtual copy so they can check things off as they go.
* **Clearly identify tasks that are due, due dates, and how assignments should be submitted**. Your Learning Management System may have a calendar function that can handle this. Alternatively, consider using a weekly Google Doc or Word document that each student can copy and annotate as they work through tasks.
* **Provide self-check quizzes with instant feedback so that students may monitor their own progress**. This functionality is built-in to many LMS systems.
* **Check-in with students frequently**, both formally in whole-class settings and individually to ensure that students are keeping on-task.
* **Encourage movement breaks**. [Movement helps improve student productivity and executive functioning skills][3]. Encourage students to get up and move around and take frequent breaks. Consider "standing meetings" where students are standing for part of their asynchronous time or walking check-ins where you call a student while they go for a walk. Each child's movement needs may be different. Encourage choosing movement that is effective for them.
* **Use a timer**. Use a tool such as [TomatoTimer][4] to encourage students to take breaks. Tomato Timer is built around the [Pomodoro Method][5] - 25-minute sprints of intense work followed by a 5-minute break and a long break after every 4 sprints. Encourage students to move during these breaks - a brief walk, some stretches, some jumping jacks, or a quick [GoNoodle][6].

### Self-Regulation
In remote learning environments, we can support student self-regulation by:

* **Developing executive functioning skills**. A child who is supported in executive functioning is less likely to feel overwhelmed and is, therefore, less likely to have trouble self-regulating.
* **Encourage journaling and logging**. Have students write down the tasks they are working on and what their difficulties are. This will help them advocate and ask for help when they need it instead of feeling overwhelmed. This may require some coaching and modeling from you if students are not familiar with how to journal.
* **Make space**. If feasible, work with families to set up a "work-from-home" space with all of the tools, supplies, and materials that are needed ready to access. Also, encourage the space to be conducive to learning (a chair, minimal distractions, etc.).
* **Encourage music (or not)**. For some populations, having music in the background can help students focus. For others, it can be a distraction. Help students figure out which is better for them.
* **Include "activator" activities**: Before class begins, be intentional about transitioning to learning and being mindful of the space. Make a deliberate transition into synchronous learning, and provide ample time for students to switch into "synchronous mode". Consider including a [mindfulness activity][7].
* **Include an "escape hatch"**: For many students, the ability to effectively manage all of the activity happening during a synchronous session (the Zoom boxes, the noises, monitoring your own behavior) can be overwhelming for students. While it is critical to teach students how to minimize distractions (show one camera at a time, select the camera that's displayed, hide the chat, etc.), students may become overwhelmed during synchronous instruction. Create a discreet way for students to signal to you that they need a break and make space for them to leave the session to calm down and return when they are ready.
* **Check-in frequently**: Include phone-calls or emails on a regular basis to check in on students as needed.
* **Encourage movement**: Like with executive function, allowing students to move when they need to can help them self-regulate.
* **Use accessibility tools**: For students who have difficulty typing or using a mouse, remember that students can move through a web page using the tab key, the enter key, and the arrow keys on the keyboard. Students can also use transcription features in Google Docs and Microsoft Word to type using their voice. Also consider allowing students to submit assignments by taking a photo or scan of a written page or a voice/video recording.

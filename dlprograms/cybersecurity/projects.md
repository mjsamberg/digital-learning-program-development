## Option 1: Create a Data Security Matrix
For this project, you'll create a data security matrix similar to [UNC Charlotte's guidelines][1] and/or NC State's [list of data elements][2] and [storage locations][3] chart that's customized for your district. You should list the data elements that your district has, applicable laws (FERPA, IDEA, Public Records laws, and board policies; most of them are included in NC State's table already).   You should also list the systems your school has access to and where data may be stored (7 points). In your reflection (3 points), address the challenges you had creating the chart and how you identified the data and systems reflected in the chart.

## Option 2: Create a Cybersecurity/Data Security Training Module
Create a training module for users on the topic(s) of your choice throughout Unit 7. The module should be factually accurate (4 points) and use elements of good professional learning outlined in Unit 5 (2 points). The module may be for online or face-to-face delivery; synchronous or self-paced but should involve a training module and a plan for follow-up (1 point). In your reflection (3 points), identify the rationale behind the training module you created and the rationale for your design, a potential plan for implementation, and any challenges you faced in designing the activity.

## Option 3: Create a BYOD Data Security Policy
Create a policy for users who are accessing work data on personally owned devices. This should include encryption and password standards, data breach notifications, and other best practices (7 points). In your reflection, address the decisions you made, challenges you faced, and how you plan to monitor compliance (3 points).

## Option 4: Choose Your Own Adventure
If there is a different product that you would like to create that is along the lines of the above projects, please contact me with a brief proposal.

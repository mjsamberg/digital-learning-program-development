Fundamentally, classroom layouts haven't changed very much in the last 100 years. Desks in rows, probably connected to uncomfortable chairs that students need to sit in for hours on end. More than likely, this furniture model is incompatible with your school's vision for digital-age learning. If for no other reason, the desks aren't large enough for a student to place a laptop and a notebook on the same surface. From a UDL standpoint, some students are too large or too small for the desks, some don't like the sensation, and some students may need to work in an isolated area to be able to focus or may need a different type of chair. For some students, seating arrangements may be dictated by their IEP or used to provide an environment that supports their learning differences.

Inspired by [unique workspaces in high-tech companies][1] around the world, many schools are starting to re-examine the furniture in their classrooms.  As this trend has become more widespread, the cost of these pieces of furniture have come down to match the cost of traditional classroom furniture. While we tend to see pictures of [very nice and expensive furniture][2], it's about the use of space even if the [furniture is used or upcycled][3] or even [homemade][4].  

Two leaders in this design process are Wake County here in Raleigh and Albemarle County in Virginia. Wake County has [revamped the way they design spaces in new schools][5], including roll-up doors in classroom pods so grade level groups can open their classrooms into one large space. They're also reducing the number of lockers in renovations and turning locker space into collaborative workspace, and they've [documented the reasons for these designs and the design specs][6] in a manual. Albemarle County in Virginia has gone through a [similar process][7] as a part of their [Capital Improvement Plan][8].  Companies like [NorvaNivel][9], [School Outfitters][10], and [Steelcase][11] provide classroom furniture. [State Contract 420-A][12] defines the vendors who can be purchased from without a bid in North Carolina.

Redesigning furniture spaces in classrooms is about creating spaces to match the school's vision for digital-age teaching and learning and providing [each student with a space][13] to meet that vision. Everything could potentially be on the table for discussion - some schools have abandoned large displays in the front of the room, in favor of smaller displays on carts so teachers and students can move them to where they're needed. As learning becomes more active and collaborative, students need space to spread out, to work in groups, and to collaborate. Other students may find that overwhelming at times, and need a sensory break and a quiet area to go work independently. Some students prefer bright and colorful environments, others prefer darker and duller. Some students may want to spread out, others may prefer the traditional hooked-together-desk. The design of furniture is focused on meeting these needs.

Some schools also purchase sensory-friendly furniture, such as [wobble stools][14] and exercise balls for students who need to fidget in their chair. There is some research that the use of these [chairs can be significantly beneficial for students with Autism][15] while other research indicates that these types of furniture may be detrimental for students with limited core strength.

Another consideration in a 1:1 environment is access to power. Even if students brought their laptops to school charged each day, heavy use combined with battery aging means that eventually students will need to recharge before the end of the day. Ensuring there are enough power strips safely around the room (cables secured to the floor so they aren't a tripping hazard) or enough wall-mounted receptacles is going to be important for students to be able to use their devices. In the absence of sufficient power, external battery packs such as the [OmniCharge][16] are an expensive but viable option for classrooms.

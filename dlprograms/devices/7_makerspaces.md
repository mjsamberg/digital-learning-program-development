More and more, schools are integrating "[makerspaces][1]", usually in the library or another common area. A makerspace is a space designed for students to explore creativity and STEM education in a hands-on way. Critically, makerspaces should be about **making** and less about**space**. 

A makerspace can be very [simple, without a lot of technology][2]. Tara Mauney has put together [a list of simple makerspace supplies][3] for elementary schools that are building their first makerspace. A makerspace doesn't need to even be a physical space - many schools do makerspaces on carts. 

Makerspaces serve different functions in a school, all (of course), aligned to your school's vision for digital-age learning. A makerspace may be used by students before or after school or during lunch for them to explore and create things that they're passionate about. They may be used by classes as spaces for students to go to create learning artifacts. Students can have free-play to explore the different tools and technologies and to create something that interests them. 

In some cases, the makerspace is woven throughout the curriculum, integrating CTE into the core of the curriculum supporting the "core" subjects. At Elizabeth Forward Middle School, outside of Pittsburgh, their [_Dream Factory_][4] integrates art, computer science, technology education, and core content. For example, their students visited a local elementary school and read stories to kindergarten students. Their English and art teachers worked with the students to design stuffed animals to represent the characters in the book. In science class, students learned about electricity and circuits while the computer science teacher did a lesson on embedded devices and sensors. The technology education teacher taught the students sewing skills. Using conductive thread, the end result of this collaboration was for students to design and create stuffed animals to give to the younger students that could respond to movement and light up. These students also created a candy bar company, designing the labels in their art class, creating a vacuum-formed mold in their shop class, preparing the chocolate in their life skills class, and calculating their profit margins in math class. 

Schools use a variety of different technologies to enhance their makerspaces. [3-D printers][5] work by melting plastic into ribbons and arranging the ribbons to form a complete product. From a spool of plastic, you can print just about anything you want out of plastic. While 3-D printing is extremely slow, the results can be incredibly useful. Looking around [Thingiverse][6], a hub for people to share 3-D printed designs, you'll find everything from action figures and models to keychains and desk organizers, to tools, and even prosthetics. Designs from Thingiverse can be downloaded and printed as is or modified. For K-12, [Tinkercad][7] is a web-based CAD tool that allows for designing 3-D prints.

In addition to a lot of tools, many makerspaces include tools for learning robotics such as [Sphero][8], [Dash and Dot][9], and [LEGO Robotics kits][10]. They may also include tools for learning about programming and embedded computing such as [Raspberry Pis][11] and [Arduino kits][12]. They may include tools for learning about electricity including conductive tape, LEDs, batteries, and even devices like MakeyMakey that let you [turn bananas into pianos][13]. But makerspaces also include tools that are much less "STEM-y". Many makerspaces include sewing machines, green screens, musical instruments, cameras and editing stations, and other things that let students create.  

The best makerspaces are responsive to their programs. While some schools need 3-D printers, others need LEGOs.  Before building a makerspace, it's important to conduct a needs assessment to figure out what's actually needed.

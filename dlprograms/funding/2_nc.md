A majority of the funding for public K-12 education in North Carolina comes from the State budget (approximately 65% of all K-12 funding). K-12 funding represents 39% of the state budget and is the largest expenditure for the State.  Federal funds, for Title I, EC, CTE, etc. contributes another 11% of state funding. Funding provided to each LEA by the county makes up the balance of funding in the state. Funding from the state and Federal governments are provided equally to each county based on a funding formula consisting of the ADM in each school district. ADM stands for _Average Daily Membership_ which is the average number of students in attendance. Calculations vary by state, but in [North Carolina it is calculated][1] as the total number of school days attended by all students in a school divided by the number of days per month. Federal funds are block grants to the state, which then allocate funds based on eligible ADM in each district.

## Challenges in School Funding
While this formula is equal, there have been long-standing concerns over whether the funding is _equitable_ resulting in one of the landmark education court cases in the State, [_Leandro v. North Carolina_][2], which has shaped much of the State's turnaround school policy for the last 20 years, as the court found that the state had not met the right of each student to a "sound basic education". As a result, the state released DSSF funds (Disadvantage and Small School Supplemental Funding) to help provide extra funds to districts in need.

In 2019, a new report from West-Ed, a California-based non-profit hired by the court to assess the current progress of the state towards meeting the Leandro decree, [released a report][3] finding that the state still continues to have significant funding-related equity problems in providing a sound basic education for all. 

Some of this inequity is exacerbated by local funding, which is provided by the counties. All capital expense funding (also called Capital Outlay) is provided to LEAs by the county. Counties can also supplement current expense funding as they choose to in order to augment funding coming from the state. Each year, the North Carolina Public School Forum releases [a report that studies the financing of public schools systems by counties][4]. This report finds that significant inequities are created by county funding. For example, Orange County funds districts the most per student at $5,256 per ADM. The seven counties providing the lowest amount per ADM (Duplin, Columbus, Graham, Greene, Robeson, Hoke, and Swain) combined provide $4,876 per ADM. These counties do not have the tax base or economic base to produce the funding needed to provide significant funding to the LEAs. 

## Budgeting Structure
All public schools in North Carolina budget according to a [Uniform Chart of Accounts][5]. To a traditional LEA, funds are allocated into a PRC (which stands for Program Report Code) which defines what the money is for, where it's from, and how it may be used. Most PRCs are a dollar allotment to the LEA, either as a set amount or a per ADM amount. Other PRCs, like the classroom teacher line item, are _position allotments_ where the state pays the salaries for the people in that allotment, regardless of what the salary for that person is (position allotments are allocated as months of employment). For that reason, districts are encouraged to put their most expensive teachers in position allotments and their new teachers in other funding sources. Local and federal funding sources also have their own PRC.

For charter schools, the state calculates the average per ADM sent to the district and sends that amount to the charter school. For local funds, each district must calculate the per ADM amount sent by the county to the LEA and then mail a check to each charter school with students from that county in membership.

### Budget Codes
The Uniform Chart of Accounts includes a singular budget code structure for each expenditure. This looks something like _1.5110.015.542.000._ The first section is called the [_Fund Code_][6], and indicates where the funds are coming from (in this case, a 1 indicates state funds). The second section is called the _[Purpose Code][7]_, which defines where the purchase will be used (5110 indicates that the purchase is for a regular instructional setting, non-EC, non-CTE. Protip: You can move assets from regular instructional settings INTO CTE and EC spaces but not vice-versa, so most districts use 5110 for all classroom purchases unless they know for a fact they'll be used somewhere else forever). The next section is the _[Program Report Code][8]_ (PRC), PRC 015 is the School Technology Fund. The fourth section is the _[object code][9]_ which defines what is being purchased (542 translates to capitalized computer hardware purchases). The last set of numbers is either going to be 000 for a district-wide purchase or it may be a school's 3-digit code. So by looking at the budget code, you can determine that the expense is for computer equipment for a classroom purchased through the School Technology Fund. The full [Chart of Accounts][10] document and [Attachment A schedule][11] defines all valid budget codes and any restrictions on funding  within each PRC. Budget allocations into each PRC are downloaded automatically into each LEA's finance system by the State and then budgeted into Purpose Codes and Object Codes by the Finance Officer. Local funding and grant funding is typically loaded in by the LEA Finance Officer in cooperation with the county or grantor to ensure that the Chart of Accounts is done correctly. 

### Allotments
Allotments for each PRC can be calculated using the [Allotment Policy Manual][12] and can be found on the [Allotment Data website][13].

## Funding Sources for School Technology
While many line items in the Chart of Accounts allow for the purchases of technology and computer equipment (for example, in many districts, EC and CTE will fund their own technology purchases), there are several line-items specifically for technology purchases in the State budget.

### School Connectivity Initiative
As described in Unit 4, North Carolina's School Connectivity Initiative pays MCNC directly for Internet access service for all public schools as well as  provides network support services, firewall, and content filtering services. While not an allocation to schools directly, it does offset the needs of schools to pay for these services.

### PRC015: School Technology Fund
The School Technology Fund is funded by statewide fines and forfeitures, and provides some funding to each LEA for technology purchases and technology-related staffing. The amount of funding in this PRC is relatively small. However, in 2019, the NC School Boards Association sued the state and [won a judgement of $730 million that was withheld from the school technology fund][14]. There is no timeline for these funds to be released to PRC015.

### Textbook and Digital Resources Line
Each LEA is allocated funding for textbooks. In 2015, the textbook line item was renamed "Textbook and Digital Resources" and expanded using a mix of state funds and Indian Gaming revenues. This allowed textbook funding to be used to purchase computers and digital content services.

### PRC073: School Connectivity
While the state pays Internet connectivity directly to MCNC, schools are still responsible for the non-E-Rate (discussed later in this unit) portion of their WAN connectivity and the non-E-Rate portion of wifi access points. The state allocates funding to districts to pay for these costs in PRC073. 

## Technology-Related Quirks in the Budget
There are two major technology-related quirks that CTOs need to be aware of in the budgeting process. The first is that state law allows capital outlay purchases to be made on any eligible current expense budget. Therefore, it is possible to buy computers on current expense budgets in many different PRCs. In addition, for a new school building, it's allowed to purchase library books as part of the capital expenditure for the new building. 

Additionally, the state budget runs on a fiscal year cycle beginning on July 1, and ending on June 30. It's possible to change a budget code or PRC for a purchase all the way up until June 30. This is because funding in some PRCs will roll in a districts ledger from year-to-year, while other funding reverts back to the state's general fund if it's not spent by June 30 (note: in order to be considered "spent", a purchase order has to be issued, received, invoiced, paid, and closed). PRC015 will roll from year-to-year. As a CTO, it's good practice to review your PRC015 expenditures at the end of each fiscal year and move them out of PRC015 into other non-recurring funds such that you can keep your PRC015 funds from year-to-year. Additionally, at the end of the year, most districts have a lot of money that is still unspent. As a CTO, it's advisable to keep a list of items that are needed in the district and that can be purchased and received quickly -- and to make sure your superintendent and finance officer know about this list, so that they'll call on you if there is money that needs to be spent. This technique has always served me well, and by scraping funding from different sources, I am typically able to double my budget at the end of each year. Superintendents would often rather see this money go to innovative technology programs than to frivolous purchases (or worse, a technology purchase that bypasses the tech department, which happens a lot in the end-of-year rush). 

## CARES Act
Nearly $390 million was made available to K-12 schools as a result of the CARES Act. An [allotment manual][15] describes these PRCs and how money may be used. There is quite a bit of money in this funding for technology, including money for digital content (PRC165), Canvas (PRC166), and computers and hotspots (though the funds can only be used to pay for hotspot devices and not service).

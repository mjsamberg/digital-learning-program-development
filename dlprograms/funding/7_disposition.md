At the end of a capitalized asset's useful life, a public school can't simply throw it away, nor can the devices be given away. [NC General Statute 160A, Article 12][1] defines how cities and schools dispose of capitalized assets. Capitalized assets need to be declared by Board policy as surplus, and then sold. Some districts [hold surplus sales in a warehouse at a predetermined date and time][2]. Others use sites like [GovDeals][3] to list surplus materials for auction or sale. 

Schools can donate devices to other schools, and other state and local agencies can donate property to a K-12 school/district. However, schools cannot simply donate devices to students. Some schools have held surplus sales where students can purchase computers for as little as $1. The devices must be wiped and loaded with a default install of the software that they shipped with (some districts use [Ubermix][4] as an alternative operating system) and the district is not allowed to provide support for the devices once they are no longer property of the district. 

While capitalized assets must be sold, a district may, by policy, allow capitalized assets to be scrapped or disassembled for parts, or that individual parts may be disposed of as needed.

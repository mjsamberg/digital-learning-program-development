The purpose of the projects in each unit is to provide you with hands-on experience with the content in the unit. Each unit will have several project options. You should choose the one project that best aligns with your personal interests and your context.

## Option 1: Develop a vision statement for digital-age learning
The needs and goals of a digital-age learning program is different in each school. It is critical when beginning a digital-age learning transition to gather input from a variety of stakeholders about **why** they believe they should be engaging in this type of transition and how they envision the business of school being impacted. Remember that the goal of digital-age learning is **not** to have students using technology but to change outcomes and the business of teaching and learning. To that end, to complete this project, you should:
* Conduct at least two focus group sessions. Focus groups may be small, but should be with two different groups (i.e. teachers, students, parents, administrators, counselors, etc.).
* Create a write-up summarizing points of consensus and divergence in the groups. From this write-up, identify the major points that should be addressed in a vision. You do \_notÂ \_need to create a formal vision statement.
* Submit your write-up, as well as your focus group protocol, and some type of evidence that the focus groups occurred (such as your notes or a recording).

### Grading
The assignment will be graded as follows:
* 2 points: Focus group protocol asks probing question that fosters conversation focusing on a vision for digital-age learning.
* 2 points: Evidence submitted for focus group.
* 3 points: Write-up synthesizes ideas from the focus groups and, discusses key take-aways, and implications for a vision for digital-age learning.
* 3 points: Major points for a vision are identified and explained.

## Option 2: Develop a Logic Model for your digital-age learning program
A [logic model][1] is a "map" that describes the relationships between cause and effect. They generally take the form of "if-then" statements in narrative form, but are often presented graphically. In educational research, a logic model usually has four columns - Inputs and Constraints, Activities, Outputs, and Effects. The purpose and context are also noted in the model (see linked example). The purpose of the logic model is to "operationalize" your vision statement - to display the activities that get you from a vision to reality. To complete this project:
* Create a logic model for your school's digital-age learning program.
* Complete a short write-up that explains how you identified the inputs, activities, and outputs; and how you decided on the relationship between them.

### Grading
* 5 points: Logic model is complete and contains sufficient detail to understand how the digital-learning program will be implemented.
* 5 points: Write-up explains the rationale behind the elements in the logic model. 

## Option 3: Complete a Digital Learning Rubric
The [North Carolina Digital Learning Progress Rubric][2] and the [Future Ready Readiness Assessment][3] are tools to support schools and districts in identifying their current status in the transition towards digital-age learning. In this assignment, you will:
* Convene a small group of stakeholders to complete either the NC-DLP or the FR Assessment. The group should meet, review the tool, and come to consensus on the current status.
* Collect evidence that the group meeting has occurred such as meeting notes or a photograph.
* Write a brief reflection on the results of the rubric and on the process. Specifically identify where there were agreements and disagreements, how you reconciled to come to consensus, and any results which surprised/encouraged/discouraged you.

### Grading
* 2 points: Tool completed and results submitted.
* 2 points: Evidence submitted for focus group.
* 3 points: Write-up synthesizes discussion from the group and, discusses key take-aways, and implications for the school.
* 3 points: Reflective element addresses the process, including points of disagreement and surprise.

## Option 4: Synthesize a digital-age instructional framework
Unit 2 presents several digital-learning instructional standards, models and frameworks, including the [ISTE standards][4], the [Connected Learning][5] framework,  and the [Florida Technology Integration Matrix][6]. For this project, you will:
* Identify the elements of these frameworks and standards that are the most useful in your context.
* Synthesize a "skinny model" for digital-age learning within your school. This should draw elements from at least two research-based models (e.g. not SAMR) into a model that fits your school's vision for digital-age learning. 
* Create a visual "glossy" for your school with the model.
* Complete a brief write-up that explains the choice of models and elements and how they align with your school's digital-age learning initiative.

### Grading
* 4 points: Write-up explains the rationale for the models and elements selected and includes alignment to the school's vision for digital-age learning.
* 4 points: Model synthesis is cohesive and easy to understand, aligns elements to limit overlap and contradiction.
* 2 points: Visual aid is easy to understand and easy for teachers to use.

## Option 5: Conduct a policy review of barrier and enabler policies to digital-age learning
The policies and procedures within a district can help encourage digital-age learning or can act as a deterrent to adoption. For this project, you will:
* Review your district and school policy and procedures manual.
* Identify elements of policies and procedures that support and enable your school's vision for digital-age learning, and elements of policies and procedures that are barriers.
* Complete a write-up identifying the policies and procedures in question, and how the elements within the policy or procedure enable digital-age learning or act as a barrier.

### Grading
* 4 points: Barrier and enabler policies are identified with the specific language within the policy constituting a barrier or an enabler.
* 6 points: Write-up sufficiently explains how the policy or procedure is considered a "barrier" or an "enabler" aligned to the school's vision for digital-age learning.

## Option 6: Create a new Responsible Use Policy for your district
In Unit 2, we discuss the need for transitioning from _Acceptable Use Policies_ to _Responsible Use Policies_. Unlike an AUP, which tends to be largely punitive, RUPs define the expectations for student technology use and how students are expected to responsibly use technology. The challenge in an RUP is to align your school's vision for digital-age learning with applicable laws (i.e. FERPA, COPPA, CIPA) while keeping children safe on your network while also not being unnecessarily restrictive. In this assignment, you will:
* Create a sample RUP for your district.
* Complete a brief write-up explaining the choices you made in writing your RUP and how these choices support your school's vision for digital-age learning. The write-up should also include any challenges you faced in writing your RUP.

### Grading
* 3 points: RUP addresses applicable laws.
* 4 points: RUP thoroughly and clearly addresses expectations for student technology use and addresses all CIPA requirements.
* 2 points: Write-up explains how the RUP aligns to the school's vision for digital-age learning.
* 1 point: Write-up addresses the challenges faced when writing the RUP.

## Option 7: Create a branding toolkit for your school/district
Consistency in branding and marketing is a critical component to being able to tell your story consistently and cleanly online. In this assignment, you will:
* Create a branding toolkit for your district that includes colors, fonts, tone, imagery, and social media standards.
* Create a branded story for your school's digital-age learning program. This is a one-pager using your school's brand that articulates the vision, the logic model, and the experiential "warm fuzzy" impact of your DL program. The document should look professional, be compelling, and be geared towards generating buy-in from a variety of audiences.
* Create at least three templates for use, including PowerPoint, letterhead, webpage, flyer, etc. 
* Complete a brief reflection explaining your choices, how they reflect your school's brand, and any compromises or challenges faced.

### Grading
* 2 points: Branding guide includes colors, fonts, tone, imagery, and social media standards.
* 2 points: Marketing document is compelling and articulates the vision for digital-age learning in the school.
* 3 points: Templates are complete and usable.
* 3 points: Reflection explains your choices, how they reflect your school's brand, and any compromises or challenges faced.

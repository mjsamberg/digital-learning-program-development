## Badging
Badges are ["digital credentials that represent an individual's skills, interests, and achievements."][1] Badging has emerged as a trend in professional learning, as it values the accomplishment and not the learning. This means that it doesn't matter whether a teacher learned a new skill by attending a PD session, going to an Edcamp, reading a book, or experimenting to figure it out, they are earning credit for the demonstration of competency in a skill. While anybody can issue badges, the [Open Badges][2] standard allows for badges to be created in such a way that they are both machine readable and transferrable across systems. Badging requires an ecosystem to succeed, with the following players:
 * Educators and others who **earn** badges.
* Professional learning providers and others who will **issue** badges.
* School districts and other employers who will **consume** a badge as evidence of competency.

Badges also should be able to convey a value - typically this has been translation to continuing education hours (CEUs), but can be as straightforward as validating that a user has the skill that the badge claims. Badges should also be designed in such a way that they are portable and an earner can take the badges with them across providers and across consumers. Finally, badges should be stackable, in that a badge should be able to combined with other badges to show a portfolio of learning. Badges are also personalized such that a user can choose both which badges to earn and how they want to demonstrate the competency required by the badge. 

[Micro-credentials][3] are a form of badges that specifically focus on educator competencies. Micro-credentials are [grounded in research and best practice][4] that can be [scaled to a variety of audiences][5]. Micro-credentials will typically require an educator to reflect on a professional practice to define it, show evidence of successful application in practice, and then complete a reflection. The submission is then reviewed by a  grader, and either feedback is provided if a teacher needs to resubmit or the badge is issued. This process has gone [through revision and validation over the years][6], with Digital Promise, Bloomboard, and the Friday institute leading the work in the field. Micro-credentials generally follow a [similar format][7] - the micro-credential shares background research and then presents a series of questions with a scoring rubric. A collection of similar micro-credentials can translate into a [_stack_][8] which is like a "super credential" that is earned when every micro-credential in the stack is earned.  [Forbes has a good article on mistakes people make when creating a badging ecosystem][9]. Some districts choose to store their own micro-credentials or use a tool like a Google Sites (example from [New Hanover County Schools][10]),  [Badgr][11] or [Credly][12] to create and issue badges. Other platforms like [Digital Promise][13] and [Bloomboard][14] allow teachers and schools to pay for access and scoring for badges.

## Gamification
Badges are derived from the principles of gamification. [Gamification][15] is the application of the principles of gaming to other contexts.  These principles are designed to promote engagement, choice, efficiency, and allow for personalization. This may include several elements including:
* Avatars, or virtual representations of a person within the gaming environment
* Points earned by accomplishing specific tasks
* Leaderboards
* Badges that demonstrate accomplishments within a quest or activity
* Meaningful stories that provide context behind the activity that a user is engaging in
* "Quests" where users complete a specific set of tasks in order to unlock a badge or achievement
* Teams that need to work together to complete specific quests
* Competition between individuals and between teams

A game-based activity doesn't have to include all elements, but typically will always include a quest and some type of achievement that can be unlocked. Games can exist as actual games in a gaming environment (i.e. [Serious Games][16]) or may simply use the design principles of gaming in another way. In eLearning contexts, [game based learning can promote higher engagement in self-paced contexts][17] and can [also be used in the classroom][18] and for [assessment][19].  

In professional learning, gaming can be explicit game-based learning quests, such as the [EPIC Academy in Surry County][20], or a [choice board][21] with some element of competition, points, and other elements of gamification.

Course Overview

Catalog Description: Study and application of principles related to digital learning program planning, facilities and resource management, and staff development in K-12 settings.

Course Overview/Prerequisites: This course is restricted to students of graduate standing. It is designed to help prepare future technology facilitators and directors to design, develop, and lead school and/or district technology programs across K-12 levels. Some lessons may translate to higher education or industry technology planning, but the majority of readings and resources in this course are geared toward K-12.

# Required Materials

Students must have access to a computer with reliable high-speed Internet access to participate in the course. A webcam and microphone are strongly recommended for synchronous meetings.

There are no required texts for this course beyond the course text mentioned above. The only required software will be Google Drive and Google Docs. All students are expected to use their NC State-issued Google accounts for course correspondence and assignments. All course materials will be freely available or accessible via Unity ID and password.

All forums and assignments will be submitted through NC State instance of Moodle (WolfWare). To log in, go to [https://wolfware.ncsu.edu]()(https://wolfware.ncsu.edu/) using your Unity ID and password, and locate &quot;ECI 518&quot;, section &quot;601&quot;.

# Course Structure

The course will be divided up into 8 units, and with exception of the first and last unit, each unit will last two weeks and will follow a similar structure.

## Course Readings

Each unit will contain a chapter in the course text. Students are expected to review the chapter, including the links provided within each chapter.

## In-Person Sessions

Every other Thursday (dates in the table below), I will hold a virtual meeting via Zoom to discuss the chapter topic in more detail, answer any questions, and provide a chance to interact with your colleagues in the course. Attendance at these sessions is optional but encouraged. Invites will be sent by Google Calendar and will be posted in Moodle.

If on-campus conditions allow, we will schedule a field trip to the NC State Libraries later in the semester.

Each unit requires two forum posts – attendance at any one virtual meeting replaces any one forum post. For example, if you attend each virtual meeting, you would only have to do one forum post. If you attend two virtual meetings, you can skip two forum posts from any unit. If you complete all discussion posts, I&#39;ll drop the lowest for each virtual meeting attended.

## Discussion Forums

Each student should post once per week in the **Reflections** forum for that unit. This means that in units 2-7, you will have two posts in each unit unless substituted for a virtual meeting (for Unit 1, you may post once). You may post either an original post or a reply to an existing post. I expect both original posts and replies to:

- Contain reflections on one or more topics from the unit
- Contain references to the course readings (including linked content) and/or other literature
- Include a key takeaway/something you&#39;re thinking about/something you&#39;re stuck on/a point of disagreement
- Combine the theoretical concepts with your experiences in the field and other relevant outside experiences.

While posts of affirmations (&quot;I agree&quot;, &quot;Me too&quot;) are encouraged, they are not considered &quot;responses for these purposes. The purpose of a discussion forum is to build conversation and community. You should not rehash discussions in an original post. Either your post continues the conversation (reply) or starts a new conversation on an original topic (new discussion). I expect the same level of thought and detail in both replies and original posts.

All posts will be graded according to the same scale. Students are expected to include the same level of detail in both original posts and in replies). **For the purposes of this task, weeks run from Monday at 12:00:00 a.m. until Sunday at 11:59:59 p.m.**

Posts will be graded as follows:

- 3 Points: Post includes a synthesis of student reflections, literature, and any relevant field experiences;
- 2 Points: The connections between reflections, literature, and field experiences are weak, disjointed, or duplicative;
- 1 Point: Post lacks sufficient detail or contains factual errors;
- 0 Points: Post is a reaction (such as &quot;I Agree&quot; or &quot;Me Too&quot;)

The second forum in each unit will be for your projects. Projects should be submitted to the project form on or before the due date. Each student will be expected to review and provide feedback to at least one other student on their projects. Grading for these will be binary – either you provide a review to a peer or not.

The Q&amp;A forum at the top of the course is for anything else. This could be a place to ask questions of me or your colleagues both about the course material or other things in your school. Think of this as your virtual PLC. If you have questions about a reading or assignment that aren&#39;t specific to you, ask them there so that everyone can see the response. Everyone will be subscribed to this form and will get an email when a post is made.

Course Projects

Units 2-7 will have a project designed to provide hands-on experience with the course content. Projects are designed to be conducted in a field-based setting (preferably K-12, but any setting will work) or by contacting friends or colleagues in the field. If this poses a challenge for you, please make sure that you notify me early in the course and I will help support you.

You should choose a project that reflects your professional interests but is not something you have done before. If two students are working in the same place, you should work to choose different projects. **Projects must be submitted to the project forum by the last day the unit is open**. Within one week after submission, you should provide constructive feedback to at least one peer within the project forum. I will also provide feedback. You may resubmit your project as many times as you need after the original deadline to earn the grade you want. **There are six projects in the course – you must complete five.** You may skip a project or I will drop the grade from the lowest project.

## Summative Activity

Unit 8 will be a summative activity in lieu of a final exam. This activity will ask you to develop a Philosophy Statement, synthesizing the material from the course and allowing you the opportunity to share with future employers how you would plan to operationalize the course content in your future careers.

# Course Evaluations

ClassEval is the end-of-semester survey for students to evaluate instruction of all university classes. The current survey is administered online and includes 12 closed-ended questions and 3 open-ended questions. Deans, department heads, and instructors may add a limited number of their own questions to these 15 common-core questions.

Each semester students&#39; responses are compiled into a ClassEval report for every instructor and class. Instructors use the evaluations to improve instruction and include them in their promotion and tenure dossiers, while department heads use them in annual reviews. The reports are included in instructors&#39; personnel files and are considered confidential.

Online class evaluations will be available for students to complete during the last two weeks of the semester for full semester courses and the last week of shorter sessions. Students will receive an email directing them to a website to complete class evaluations. These become unavailable at 8am on the first day of finals.

Please refer to this course&#39;s attendance, absence, and deadline policies for additional details. If you are quarantined or otherwise need to miss class because you have been advised that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, you should not be penalized regarding attendance or class participation. However, you will be expected to develop a plan to keep up with your coursework during any such absences.  If you become ill with COVID-19, you should follow the steps outlined in the &quot;Health and Participation in Class&quot; section above. COVID 19-related absences will be considered excused; documentation need only involve communication with your instructor.
- **Course Meeting Schedule** : Your course might not have a traditional meeting schedule in Fall 2020.  Be sure to pay attention to any updates to the course schedule as the information in this syllabus may have changed. Please discuss any questions you have with the instructor.
- **Classroom Seating:**  To support efficient, effective contact tracing, please sit in the same seat when possible and take note of who is sitting around you; instructors may also assign seats for this purpose.
- **Technology Requirements: ** This course may require particular technologies to complete coursework.  Be sure to review the syllabus for these expectations, and see [go.ncsu.edu/syllabus-tech-requirements]()(https://go.ncsu.edu/syllabus-tech-requirements) to find out more about technical requirements for your course.

## Course Delivery Changes Related to COVID-19

Please be aware that the situation regarding COVID-19 is frequently changing, and the delivery mode of this course may need to change accordingly, including from in-person to online.  Regardless of the delivery method, we will strive to provide a high-quality learning experience.

## Grading/Scheduling Changing Options Related to COVID-19

If the delivery mode has a negative impact on your academic performance in this course, the university has provided tools to potentially reduce the impact:

- **Enhanced S/U Grading Option** :  [https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-sat-grading/]()(https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-sat-grading/)
- **Late Drop** :  [https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-latedrop/]()(https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/covid-19/spring2020-latedrop/)

In some cases, another option may be to request an incomplete in the course.  Before using any of these tools, discuss the options with your instructor and your academic advisor.  Be aware that if you use the enhanced S/U, you will still need to complete the course and receive at least a C- to pass the course.

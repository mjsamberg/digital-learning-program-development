This site was created by [Mark Samberg](http://go.ncsu.edu/mark) for the purpose of hosting course content and is made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA license). All content is housed in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mjsamberg/courses). You're free to use any content you would like, but I ask that you rebrand it for your institution (or use the markdown files only) if you choose to use the site wholesale. While much of the content is generally applicable, some of the content is specific to North Carolina and is labeled appropriately.

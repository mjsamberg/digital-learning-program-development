The assignment this week is probably exactly what you would expect: format the text, images, tables, and lists in your website using CSS. Create a new CSS file, link it from your web pages, add classes and IDs to your content, and then build out your CSS to format your content.

Commit to the same GitHub repository that you have been using with "Added CSS" in your commit message.

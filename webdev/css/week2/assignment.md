## Sample - Navigation
Many of the items that we have discussed thus far can be summed up in a navigation bar. Review the code sample below. Notice that we use the ```<nav>``` container for the navbar, a ```<ul>``` because navigation is basically a list of links and a variety of the CSS tools we've discussed, including list stying, paddings and margins, Flexbox and responsive principles to create this navigation bar.

* Add the following items:
	* A second page with additional content of your choice (create a new HTML file in your site by right-clicking in your files list and selecting "new File")
	* At least two links: one that's relative (between your two pages) and at least one to an external website.
	* At least one image.
* You can preview your webpage directly in VS Code by clicking the magnifying glass in the upper right or by  right clicking on the Index.html file in VS Code and selecting *Open In Browser*  
* Save this file, commit it to GitHub and push your changes. Use "HTML Week 2 Assignment" somewhere in your commit message.

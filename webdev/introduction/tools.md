We are going to be using a variety of tools during this semester. The core tools that we will be using is a text editor, our web browsers, and GitHub.

## Text Editors
There are a number of good code text editors that you are welcome to use based on your preferences. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (Windows) and [TextWrangler](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) (Mac) are two of the oldest and simplest.  

However, the most popular tool right now, by far, is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an open source tool from Microsoft. VS Code is incredibly feature-rich and is recommended for this course. Read the [Getting Started Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics) to download and install VS Code. 


## Markdown Syntax
Markdown is a very simple markup language that we will be using for this assignment. It is a simple way of styling basic text without digging into full HTML. Read about the [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) here.

## Git
Git is a version control system. A version control system is a database that includes each copy of our code changes, along with what changed. Git (and GitHub, a cloud-based service that runs Git) automatically has features that allow multiple coders to work on a file at the same time and then reconcile all of those changes. People can even take bits of code to work on, make changes, and then include those changes in the original code (called branching and merging).

While most people use GitHub at the command line, we'll be using GitHub Desktop which is a GUI interface for GitHub.

Watch [Github Desktop Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7f8qJscmRE) or [read the manual](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories)

# Week 1 Assignment
 * Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) on your computer. 
 * Access GitHub Classroom from Moodle
 * Clone the Week 1 assignment using GitHub Desktop (click on the assignment, click the *Code* button at the upper right of the Github screen, and click *Open with GitHub Desktop* )
 * Open the readme.md markdown file in VS Code using the *Open in Visual Studio Code* button in GitHub Desktop. 
 * Complete your bio using the markdown syntax. Headers are already provided but you can add additional ones as needed or as directed by the assignment. 
 * [Preview your file in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown). 
 * Save the file and switch back to GitHub Desktop.
 * Commit your changes to the repository (select the file, add a detailed commit message describing your changes).
 * Push the repository to GitHub.
 * Open the repository on the GitHub website and copy the URL (and validate that the readme.md file is updated correctly).
 * Submit the URL to the discussion board in Unit 1 on Moodle so your classmates can learn about you.

We are going to be using a variety of tools during this semester. The core tools that we will be using is a text editor, our web browsers, and GitHub.

## Text Editors
There are a number of good code text editors that you are welcome to use based on your preferences. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) (Windows) and [TextWrangler](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html) (Mac) are two of the oldest and simplest.  

However, the most popular tool right now, by far, is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an open source tool from Microsoft. VS Code is incredibly feature-rich and is recommended for this course. Read the [Getting Started Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics) to download and install VS Code. 


## Markdown Syntax
Markdown is a very simple markup language that we will be using for this assignment. It is a simple way of styling basic text without digging into full HTML. Read about the [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples](markdown syntax) here.

## Git
Git is a version control system. A version control system is a database that includes each copy of our code changes, along with what changed. Git (and GitHub, a cloud-based service that runs Git) automatically has features that allow multiple coders to work on a file at the same time and then reconcile all of those changes. People can even take bits of code to work on, make changes, and then include those changes in the original code (called branching and merging). Watch these overview videos:

While most people use GitHub at the command line, we'll be using GitHub Desktop which is a GUI interface for GitHub.

Watch [Github Desktop Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7f8qJscmRE) or [read the manual](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories)
